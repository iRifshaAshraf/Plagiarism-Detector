Plagiarism Detection System

Plagiarism has become a significant challenge across academic and professional domains, undermining the principles of originality and authenticity. To counteract this issue, we've developed a sophisticated Plagiarism Detection System, aimed at identifying instances where individuals attempt to present external work as their own.

Features:

Comprehensive Detection: Our system meticulously compares input files and text against an extensive database, enabling accurate detection of potential plagiarism.

Text Pre-processing: The input undergoes preprocessing to remove irrelevant sections, ensuring that the comparison focuses solely on the meaningful content.

Flexible Input: Beyond file comparison, our system allows users to input text for analysis directly. This feature enhances versatility, accommodating a wide range of plagiarism detection scenarios.

Methodology:

Pre-processing: Irrelevant content, such as headers and footers, is removed from input files.

Comparison: The pre-processed text is systematically compared with entries within the database using sophisticated algorithms.

Alert Generation: The system generates alerts and reports for potential instances of plagiarism, aiding users in taking necessary actions.

Getting Started:

To utilize the Plagiarism Detection System:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the system and input the desired file or text for analysis.
